This spiders the FOI disclosure log  pages of transport, health and communities in NSW & posts the details to a database which is django compatible. If you start djangos admin interface you can see the details ready to create a site.

Other disclosure sites can be added easily using scrapy. To see example spiders see ./disclosures/disclosure/spiders (directory structure names are confusing, can be changed later)

SETUP

In a sec...


TODO  - SPIDER AND BACKEND
* fix directory structure names to be less confusing
* make the reference number the unique identifier in the SQL DB
* create BASH script to spider periodically (say daily) and coupled with reference number being unique identifier only add to database when new entries come up


Suggestion for future features

* for each entry, check if it provides an email address as reference
