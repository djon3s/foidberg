This spiders the FOI disclosure log  pages of transport, health and communities in NSW & posts the details to a database which is django compatible. If you start djangos admin interface you can see the details ready to create a site.

Other disclosure sites can be added easily using scrapy. To see example spiders see ./disclosures/disclosure/spiders (directory structure names are confusing, can be changed later) You'll need to have the XPATH of the fields you want to grab handy, a useful way to get this is with the firebug extension for firefox
.

HOW TO USE

Coming...

TODO  - SPIDER AND BACKEND
* fix directory structure names to be less confusing
* make the reference number the unique identifier in the SQL DB
* create BASH script to spider periodically (say daily) and coupled with reference number being unique identifier only add to database when new entries come up


Suggestion for future features

* for each entry, check if it provides an email address as reference, if it does provide create an email to automatically request document on behalf of site, future emails with attachments are directed to be checked by admin interface before publishing. IF no attachment, email is forwarded to email of admin to continue conversation manually. It sucks having to get people to email someone to view data they are entitled to. :-(
